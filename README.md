word-frequency-counter
======================

What it says on the tin. Meant to process digital texts.



Eventually, I hope to add support for other systems.


I decided to create it because I was unhappy with other versions I knew of, and I knew this was in my reach programming-wise. Eventually, I hope to program in  a way to detect when certain words are being over-used, as a service to authors who wish to know. At the moment, it serves as a rudimentary version of that, which can be combed through by hand.

Included file 'falsetruths.txt' is there to test with, as is 'poisonbelt.txt'. The Poison Belt was written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, and is in the public domain in the US. False Truths was written by Storskarve (http://storskarvewashere.tumblr.com/) and can be found here (http://storskarvewashere.tumblr.com/post/20892174363/false-truths). I have special permission from the author to use it for testing this program, and including it in the repository.
