======================

What it says on the tin. Meant to process digital texts.



Eventually, I hope to add support for other systems.


I decided to create it because I was unhappy with other versions I knew of, and I knew this was in my reach programming-wise. Eventually, I hope to program in  a way to detect when certain words are being over-used, as a service to authors who wish to know. At the moment, it serves as a rudimentary version of that, which can be combed through by hand.
